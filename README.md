Translate Overcast

## How to do it:
In your own fork, duplicate `en.json` and rename it with your language code. (`fr.json` for French, `es.json` for Spanish, etc.) Edit the messages, as well as change the language code at top. Then make a pull request. When we add new words/phrases, you can make new pull requests to change it. Please, no Google Translate! You should be native/fluent in the language you choose!

## When will this be in Overcast?
We plan for the 1st real release to come out by the end of March 2019. We will add translations once there are at least three choices.

## Will I get credit?
Of course!
